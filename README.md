# Company_Employee_Data_Analysis_Dashboard
The dataset contains 1,470 rows and 39 columns. It appears to be focused on employee data, likely for an HR analytics use case, such as attrition analysis or workforce management.
The dataset contains a mix of categorical (e.g., "Attrition", "Gender") and numerical (e.g., "Age", "Years At Company") variables.
It is well-structured, with no missing values reported.
The dataset is rich in features, suitable for various HR analyses, such as:
Attrition prediction.
Employee satisfaction analysis.
Performance evaluation.
